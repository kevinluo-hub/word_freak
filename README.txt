In this program, files are taken as input, in the form of standard input, either directly via terminal or operator pipe, or accept files as command line arguements, or accept the environment variable called WORD_FREAK. The program always check the availability of all the input sources mentioned above, and if it's by command line or environment variable, a large char array, with the size of 2048, is used to improve the speed significantly compared to taking it char by char, but for standard input it is taken char by char as offset doesn't work on it. After words are taken in, they are put into one of the tree in the tree list with BST rule, consisting of 26 elements, each stores words starting with one alphabet in order. Finally, the words and their occurances stored in the tree are written in the in-order traversal in the output file, which is either created if not pre-existing, or clear if already existed, in the format of "longest word : longest length digit".
